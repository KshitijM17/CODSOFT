                    <h3>1. Gesture Control Car (Using Arduino)</h3>
                    <p>In this innovative project, I designed and implemented a Gesture Control Car using Arduino as the brain of the system. The project utilized an ADxl335 accelerometer for precise gesture recognition, allowing users to intuitively control the car's movements through hand gestures. The communication between the gesture controller and the car was established using the NRF24L01 wireless module, ensuring seamless and responsive command transmission.
                    To bring the project to life, I integrated a motor driver to control the car's movement based on the received gestures. This not only showcased my proficiency in hardware integration but also highlighted the practical application of gesture control technology in real-world scenarios. The project not only demonstrated technical expertise but also highlighted my ability to create interactive and engaging solutions through the fusion of Arduino, sensors, and wireless communication.</p>
                    <h3>2. Bottle Cap filling Machine (Using PLC)</h3>
                    <p>In this project, I successfully developed a Bottle Cap Filling Machine by harnessing the power of Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and Human-Machine Interface (HMI) technologies. This sophisticated system streamlines the bottle capping process with precision and efficiency.
                    The heart of the system, the PLC, orchestrates the entire filling operation, ensuring accurate control over the filling process. Leveraging the capabilities of the PLC, I implemented a robust logic sequence to optimize bottle cap placement, reducing errors and enhancing overall production quality.
                    To provide user-friendly control and monitoring, I integrated an intuitive HMI into the system. The HMI not only allows operators to easily set parameters for different bottle sizes and cap types but also provides real-time feedback on the machine's status. This user interface enhances the overall usability of the bottle cap filling machine, making it accessible for operators with varying levels of technical expertise.
                    Through the fusion of PLC and HMI technologies, this project showcases my ability to design and implement automated systems that enhance operational efficiency and accuracy in industrial settings. The Bottle Cap Filling Machine serves as a testament to my proficiency in combining hardware and software components to create reliable and user-friendly solutions for complex manufacturing processes.</p>
                    <h3>3. Weather Station (Using Node MCU)</h3>
                    <p>In this project, I engineered a Weather Station that seamlessly integrates cutting-edge technologies to capture, analyze, and present real-time weather data. The core components include a NodeMCU microcontroller, a DHT22 sensor for precise temperature and humidity measurements, and the utilization of ThingSpeak cloud platform for data storage and visualization. Additionally, the system incorporates a DC fan for environmental control based on the acquired weather data.
                    The NodeMCU, serving as the project's brain, orchestrates the collection of weather data through the DHT22 sensor, ensuring accurate and reliable measurements. These data points are then transmitted to the ThingSpeak cloud, creating a centralized hub for comprehensive data analysis and visualization.
                    To enhance the practical application of the weather station, I integrated a DC fan into the system. This fan can be autonomously controlled based on the real-time weather conditions, providing a dynamic response to temperature and humidity changes. For instance, the fan may be activated to cool down the environment if the temperature rises above a certain threshold.
                    This project showcases my proficiency in Internet of Things (IoT) applications, sensor integration, cloud-based data management, and the implementation of responsive control systems. The Weather Station not only serves as a testament to my technical skills but also highlights the potential for creating smart and adaptive solutions in the field of environmental monitoring.</p>
                    <h3>4. Child Monitoring System (Using Raspberry Pi)</h3>
                    <p>In this project, I designed an innovative Child Monitoring System using a Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi Camera, and a Buzzer to ensure the safety and well-being of children in various environments. This comprehensive system combines hardware and software components to provide real-time monitoring and alerts.
                    The Raspberry Pi serves as the central processing unit, orchestrating the monitoring process. The Raspberry Pi Camera captures live video footage, enabling parents or guardians to remotely monitor their child's activities. The system is equipped with intelligent image processing algorithms to detect potential hazards or unusual situations.
                    To enhance the safety features, I integrated a buzzer into the system. The buzzer is programmed to trigger alerts in response to specific events, such as detecting unexpected movements or potential dangers. This audible notification system ensures that caregivers are promptly informed of any concerning situations, even if they are not actively monitoring the live video feed.
                    By incorporating the Raspberry Pi, Raspi Cam, and a Buzzer, this Child Monitoring System exemplifies my skills in hardware integration, image processing, and alert mechanisms. The project emphasizes the potential of technology in creating practical and responsive solutions for child safety, offering peace of mind to parents and caregivers.</p>
                    <h3>5. Marksheet Generator (Using c & c++)</h3>
                    <p>In my recent project, I developed a Marksheet Generator using a combination of C and C++ programming languages. This innovative system automates the process of generating student mark sheets, streamlining the traditionally manual and time-consuming task.
                    The program, written in C and C++, utilizes a user-friendly interface to input student information, including names, roll numbers, and individual subject marks. Leveraging the power of C++ for object-oriented programming, the system efficiently organizes and manages this data, ensuring accuracy and reliability in mark sheet generation.
                    To enhance the functionality of the Marksheet Generator, I incorporated features such as automatic calculation of total marks, percentage, and grade based on predefined grading criteria. The program is designed to generate neatly formatted mark sheets, providing a clear and comprehensive overview of each student's academic performance.
                    This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in C and C++ programming but also showcases my ability to create practical and efficient solutions for educational administration. The Marksheet Generator simplifies the grading process, saving time for educators and administrators while maintaining precision in result computation.</p>
                    <h3>Autonomous V tail Plane</h3>
                    <p>In a recent project, I successfully designed and implemented an Autonomous V-Tail Drone, incorporating advanced features for autopilot mode using an MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope sensor. This system ensures precise direction control and acts as a failsafe mechanism, triggering autopilot mode if the drone goes out of the range of the transmitter. The MPU6050 is seamlessly interfaced with an Arduino, and servo motors are employed for control surface manipulation.
                    The MPU6050 sensor plays a pivotal role in the project, providing real-time data on the drone's orientation. This data is then processed by the Arduino to make dynamic adjustments to the servo motors, allowing the drone to maintain stability and control in various flight conditions. In the event of the drone going beyond the transmitter range, the autopilot mode is activated, leveraging the MPU6050 data to guide the drone safely back to a predefined location.
                    To cater to manual control, an external controller is integrated to provide the pilot with a user-friendly interface. This allows the drone to be manually operated when needed, offering flexibility and control during different phases of flight.
                    This project not only showcases my expertise in sensor integration and microcontroller programming but also emphasizes the implementation of failsafe mechanisms for enhanced safety and autonomous control. The Autonomous V-Tail Drone serves as a testament to my ability to develop sophisticated aerial systems with both autonomous and manual control capabilities.</p>
